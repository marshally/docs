# Notes from Mentorship Meetings with Ken

## Context

When I was first transitioning from leading through command into leading through influence, I was fortunate enough to have a chief architect in another part of the business who had performed the role at multiple large companies. I took notes on our 1x1 meetings over the years that he mentored me, and I've collected some of the top gems here to share with others who might be on that journey on leading through influence.

## Key Pieces of Advice

### Be Self Aware

- understand that to listen to you people need to trust you first - trust is earned and takes effort
- having the best design or technical arguments is insufficient - you need to spend time understanding and demonstrating that you have understood before solutions can be accepted
- watch for when you push people too far out of their comfort zone because they shut down and stop accepting new ideas

### Role of the Architect

- accountable for the overall technical quality of the products 
- continuously evolving and sharing a long term vision so we all know where we want to go
- not the dictator, but the validator - architects should be mostly concerned with the things that are hard to change and the guardrails for quality - give teams freedom to make most decisions for themselves but make sure to first place the right constraints and to inspect the outcomes
- team autonomy is the goal, but responsible autonomy requires scrutiny and healthy debate as to how those decisions effect the whole company
- kindling and nuturing engineering passion in the teams -- sometimes by inspiring, sometimes by praising and disseminating
- scanning the horizons for signs of misalignment early
- staying aware of the TCO (total cost of ownership) for development
- Be the glue between management, product, and engineering teams - flexing to fill whatever the current gap in the organization is and adapting as the org changes
- comfortable speaking truth to power and escalating when the wrong outcome is likely
- not just disagree and commit, but disagree and CHAMPION
- your primary responsibility is to the VP/Director of Engineering - you are their technical right hand (even when there are multiple you are responsible to) - you must spend time acting as a member of their staff and a leader in your organization, not as an IC
- you must understand the business - spend time with the product leadership team understanding their strategy and needs
- you are *NEVER A CONSULTANT*, you are *ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE BUSINESS OUTCOMES*
- you need to ensure a vision emerges, preferably from the team and not just your own head

> Good decisions cannot be made without first understanding consequences of the options. I reserve the right to keep repeating the same problem in different ways until you have demonstrated to me that you understand. Then we make a decision and move on.

> We do not have an architecture unless we have a clear vNext picture that everyone can draw, and a vCurrent that we can prove is an incremental step on the path to vNext.

### Architect's Way of Working

> In any group of engineers, the aggregated intelligence is always greater than YOURS

- You will be *wrong*. A lot. Embrace it and lean into it. Do not try to pretend otherwise
- harvest the answers from the team, do not push your ideas on them
- listen first, talk later (and less)
- ask directed questions to harvest/highlight more information
- focus on understanding why any requirement or supposition or solution exists
- always assume best intent 
  - it is easy to tell ourselves a story about why someone is doing something. Usually we are wrong. Instead assume that everyone is doing the best they can under the constraints they think they have - look to expose those constraints and either correct the constraints, or adapt your view to one that accounts for these constraints
  - No one is ever the villan in the story of their own lives   
- focus on good solutions, not perfect ones 
- get the non functional requirements defined early - it is key to understanding the full scope fo the problem
- do not disparrage mistakes of the past - everyone makes the best decisions they could at the time they were made - focus on the future, do not dwell on sins
- remember that the team is closer to the problem than you are -- they will have more nuances that you do not have access to 
- double check assumptions, goals, and end-games -- typically you will find unstated lack of alignment that complicates things - if you aren't all going to the same place, you will not agree on how to get there. Get those alignments early instead of discovering them late in the cycle
- avoid domineering analogies or dictatorial methods - people shut down and you lose trust
- embrace being vulnerable with others - "I don't understand" or "I'm confused" or "I don't know a lot about that" are powerful tools that show others you want to learn and open your own mind to a more team dynamic of peer discovery which is more useful for problem solving
- Focus on problem solving as a team rather than individuals
- Show humility - the team can find answers you cannot
- Remember: We are one team. My job is to help the team find good solutions
- Try different tools - the same tool will not consistently work with all people in all circumstances
- Watch out for pushing too hard - people will shut down - recognize when it starts to happen and move on to something else or take a break
- The team is who they are, our job is to maximize their effectiveness, not wish we had a different team
- Make sure the team is getting primary credit for the ideas and work - your ego should take a back seat 
  - If you are good at this, the right people notice and you don't have to worry about it 
  - If you take credit away from the team you burn bridges. Your job is to help the team succeed, not build your own accolades
- If you build a reputation of being someone teams can count on then your load lightens because people start arriving at your door proactively asking for help. If you find yourself having to bulldoze your way into conversations - check yourself and how you are operating: you probably are being seen as an interloper. Spend more time enrolling yourself with teams by working closer with them. Maybe pick a team and take a couple sprints where you scrum with the team and pull stories to build trust
- your personal goals are less important than the company ones - set aside your favorite pets and focus on business value 
- technology is a side effect not a purpose
- We may not reach consensus, but we should attempt it
  - Have follow up conversations with dissenting viewpoints
  - ask for clarifications
  - ask for opinions
  - demonstrate that you are actively listening and understanding the concerns
  - collect new information that may have been missed and disseminate that information so we are all working with the same inputs


### Personal Affirmations

- I am never as smart as a collective group
- I am the team and the team is me. We work together and only have success together. The only success is team success
- I need to get alignment across these teams
- Teams are often misaligned because the engineering leaders have a difference of opinion - I need to go spend time with engineering leaders to help create that alignment
- I will not rant like an angry lunatic - it devalues my brand and alienates others
- I must pay attention to the reactions of others and adjust my tone/message/approach based on the room's reception
- I must stay open to new ideas - this is a key source of innovation
- I must ensure that all relevant inputs to the decisions are well understood and agreed to by all stake holders before a solution can be proposed - failure to align the inputs leads to misalignment on the solution evaluation criteria and leads to more churn
- Avoid repeating the exact same statements - find new ways to say it in an attempt to be undertsood. Saying the same thing repeatedly causes people to shut you out 
- I can be polite and firmly insistent without being a jerk
- When I see something happening that I think is the wrong outcome for the customer or the overall engineering team or the company, I keep escalating until the right level of management has understood the problem and decided on a course of action
